## dust sensor Nova SDS011
### Status
In alpha test since 11th of May 2017
### Description
The Nova dust sensor is simple to connect via a TTL USB. The serial output is 9600 baud, and input (commands)/ output are binary telegrams.
One can operate in working mode, define duty cycles in minutes and put the module in sleep till the wakeup command. Sleeping mode will switch the internal fan off.

Th module is not as popular yet as the Sinyei. Seems to operate reliable. The values are in ug/m3 (not pcs/0.01qf)!

Cost pricing varies between € 30 (Ali Express)  and € 45 (German webshop).

In order to be able to put thye module a sleep (life time in permanent mode is about 8000 hours) the python input script is based on the code from Frank Heuer, see `https://gitlab.com/frankrich/sds011_particle_sensor`

### Usage
The module MySDS011.py will drive the sds011 sensor. Test it first as standalone python script. Use the Conf settings to increase the debug level, to turn multi threading off.

The module is able to convert the mass measurement into pcs per qubic feet. Change the Conf['units'] from ug/m3 to pcs/qf.

The duty cycle (sampling timing of the dust count) is in units of minutes. If the interval time (default 2X 1 minute sampling time) is large enough, the sensor will be put in sleeping modus.
