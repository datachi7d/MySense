Output to MySQL database.
For every MySense instance a table (<project>_<serial>) with archiving  date/time of entry, update, values of pollutants and meteo data.
The table "Sensors" will archive the sensor instance identification information as eg location, start time, last seen data, activity, different installed sensors information.

Use eg. phpadmin or Sequel Pro (both are free applications) to easily view the archived data. And use Behoud de Parel visualisation tooling for producing graphs on your website.
